A vscode extension similar to the ssh extension that allows you to log in and view the contents of your POD from vscode.

Lazy triple generation via non-reasoning methods (is this an RML thing?). E.g. when I get the triple << ex:img ex:subject ?s >> ex:likelyHood ?p; I might want the request for that data to be the **trigger** to execute a machine learning algorithm against ex:img. Not sure of the best way of doing this - perhaps by introducing something called 'turtle-script'.

Now an interesting research question is how to handle such data in aggregators.
