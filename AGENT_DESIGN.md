1. The MVP is to check if an endpoint supports the operation we want to perform
^^ My preference would be to try and achieve this primarily using reasoning and with limited code logic.

2. The next step is to use the details to change one part of the operation to improve performance
3. The next step would be to dynamically negotiate throughout the process (e.g. with each actor in Comunica)
4. Furthermore we then need to customise operations based on function data in the doc. rather than just selecting from a set of known operations.
